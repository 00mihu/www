        Thor: Love and Thunder has landed online and, as is customary around these parts, we're here to break the film's latest teaser down for you.
        With Thor: Love and Thunder set to arrive in theaters on July 8, it's high time we received another glimpse at the upcoming MCU movie. It's nice of Marvel Studios to have obliged, then, with the latest Thor 4 trailer giving us our first look at Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher among many other things. 
        There's a lot going on in the official Thor 4 trailer, so much so that we suspect you'll have missed some pretty important moments, locations, and Easter eggs within its two-minute runtime. This is a Marvel Phase 4 project, after all, so there are plenty of MCU and comic book references that Marvel Studios could pack into the teaser and the final cut of the film. 
        It goes without saying, but you'll want to watch the Thor: Love and Thunder trailer before you read on.</p>

    <p>Well, the superhero movie's official trailer has confirmed where he'll be based: Indigarr.
That name will be instantly recognizable to Marvel comic book fans. Indigarr is a desert world that debuted in Thor: God of Thunder #1 in November 2012, which is the first issue in writer Jason Aaron's iconic comic series that stars the Norse god and Gorr the God Butcher.
Why is this significant? Apart from the fact that Gorr is the chief villain in Thor: Love and Thunder, the Taika Waititi-directed film has been heavily inspired by Aaron's Thor comic run. With Aaron's series being a chief influence during Thor 4's development, it's unsurprising that Indigarr features in some capacity.
How do we know that Indigarr is the planet that Thor has relocated to in order to find some inner peace? For starters, you can see the giant tree – which he meditates under – in the background at the 0:03 mark of the trailer. That's the moment where Korg is telling Indigarr's native population about Thor's adventures as a space pirate. Oh, and the alien race Korg is speaking to just happen to be blue-skinned and wear similar clothing to the extraterrestrial race that resides on Indigarr in the comics. Therefore, Thor must be in self-imposed exile on Indigarr in Thor: Love and Thunder.
